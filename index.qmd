  In response to the proposal of Tsafnat et al. to converge towards three open health data standards, we argue that such convergence is a necessary but not sufficient condition to achieve interoperability. This viewpoint provides a critical reflection from the perspective of paradox of open. We illustrate the implications of this reflection in two specific contexts, namely i) federated learning health data platforms in high income countries; and ii) data platforms in low- and middle income countries based on the OpenHIE architecture.

## The paradox of interoperability also needs to consider the paradox of open

Tsafnat et al. rightly draw attention to the fragmented state of affairs of data standards in health care [@tsafnat2024converge], for which they propose that the health informatics community converge on just three open standards, namely i) OpenEHR for clinical care and administration; ii) Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for data exhange and iii) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP) for longitudinal analysis. They argue that open data standards, backed by engaged communities, hold an advantage over proprietary ones and therefore should be chosen as the steppingstones towards achieving true interoperability.

We feel, however, that besides the paradox of interoperability put forward in their paper, another paradox requires attention, namely the paradox of open [@keller2021paradox]. Essentially, "... this paradox is that openness of data is both a challenge to and an enabler of concentrations of power. The ideas of open access and free reuse of information goods continue to be some of the most powerful challenges to the exclusive control by corporations and states over information goods. Yet making such resources open also exposes them to the imbalances of power that shape these societies – and in the worst cases serves to strengthen these imbalances." Put differently, having open standards is no guarantee that we will be able to breakthrough the current status quo with huge asymmetries in terms of bargaining power, access control and development resources related to health data sharing. We posit that having open data standards is a necessary condition in improving the current state of affairs, yet it is not a sufficient condition.

In the analysis of Keller and Tarkowski, the conventional open approaches flourish under two types of conditions. First, projects where many people contribute to the creation of a common resource have proven succesful. This is the story of Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, Blender.org, and the countless free software projects that provide much of the internet’s infrastructure. Numerous studies have analysed and quatified what the benefits of these types of open ecosystems are, without which the digital economy as we know today would not have existed. Tsafnat et al. in fact reference Reynolds and Wyatt who already argued in 2011 "... for the superiority of open source licensing to promote safer, more effective health care information systems. We claim that open source licensing in health care information systems is essential to rational procurement strategy" [@reynolds2011open]. More than a decade later, we observe that only a very small fraction of health IT systems are based on open source, the majority of which are used in low- and middle income countries [@digitalpublicgoods].

The second condition which has proven fruitful for the conventional open approach, pertains to circumstances where opening up is the result of external incentives or requirements, rather than voluntary actions. This is the story of publicly-funded knowledge production like Open Access academic publications, cultural heritage collections in the Public Domain, Open Educational Resources (OER), and Open Government data. A canonical example in the birth of the GSM standard, which was mandated by European legislation.[^1]

[^1]: See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM#Initial_European_development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM#Initial_European_development) for details.

This conventional perspective on openness already points to a salient difference between FHIR vis-a-vis OpenEHR and OMOP, namely that it is the former is the only one that has been mandated (or at least strongly recommended) in some jurisdictions. In the US, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has introduced a steady stream of new regulations, criteria, and deadlines in Health IT that has resulted in significant adoption of FHIR [@firely2023fhir]. In India, the open Health Claims Exchange protocol specification - which is based on FHIR - has been mandated by the Indian government as the standard for e-claims handling [@hcx]. The African Union recommends all new implementations and digital health system improvements use FHIR as the primary mechanism for data exchange [@tilahun2023african], but doesn't say anything about the use of, for example, OpenEHR for administrative systems of record. These external incentives have resulted in a large boost in both commercial and public (open source) development activities in the FHIR ecosystem. One such example is the speed with which the Bulk FHIR API has been defined and implemented in almost all major implementations [@mandl2020push;@jones2021landscape]. It has also led to more people voluntarily contributing to FHIR-related open source projects, which has resulted in a wide offering of FHIR components across major technology stacks (Java, Python, .NET).

In comparison, the ecosystem of OMOP and OpenEHR is have not yet profited from external incentives to grow their community. smaller than that of FHIR. The majority of OMOP components are run by Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) ...[Say something that OMOP still has a relatively large ecosystem, with R libraries, pyOMOP etc. The OpenEHR, however, seems subscritical. We are not judging the content and approach of OpenEHR, but there are just so few implementations.]

## The need for a new understanding of openess for health data sharing

Yet, this conventional debate on ‘openness’, which originally focused on open source and open standards as discussed above, has been superseded by “... conflicts about privacy, economic value extraction, the emergence of artificial intelligence, and the destabilizing effects of dominant platforms on (democratic) societies. Instead of access to information, the control of personal data has emerged in the age of platforms as the critical contention” [@keller2021paradox]. These conflicts are particularly salient in the healthcare domain, where people are generally willing to share their health data to receive the best care (primary use), while the attitude towards secondary use of health data varies greatly depending on the type and context [@cascini2024health]. Case studies on digital platforms in healthcare point to an emerging pattern where the focus shifts from the digital platform with its defining software and hardware components, to the data as the primary object of interest in and of itself [@ozalp2022digital;@alaimo2022organizations]. This observation ties into with the proposed research agenda by de Reuver et al. to consider data platforms as a phenomenon distinct from digital platforms [@dereuver2018digital;@dereuver2022openness].

The shift in perspective from digital platforms supporting primary data sharing toward data platforms supporting secondary data sharing is a contentious issue both in high income countries, with for example the ongoing efforts to establish a European Health Data Space [@otto2022designing], and low- and middle income countries that are aiming to deploy nationwide health information exchanges to support primary and secondary data use at once [@mamuye2022health]. A better understanding of openness is particularly relevant if we are to realize a solidarity-based approach to health data sharing that i) gives people a greater control over their data as active decision makers; ii) ensures that the value of data is harnessed for public good; and iii) moves society towards equity and justice by counteracting dynamics of data extraction [@kickbusch2021lancet;@prainsack2022data;@prainsack2023beyond].

It is beyond the scope of this viewpoint to unpack all these different perspectives, ongoing research etc. etc. In the remainder of this paper, we want to share practical insights obtained from two distinct projects, where these issues on openness are prevalent but manifest themselves differently. Also, it illustrates that in these real-world examples the trichotomy proposed by Tsafnat et al. doesn't apply. In the first use case, we argue that FHIR is preferred for (certain types of) longitudinal analysis. In the second use case, we see FHIR being used as the administrative system of record. 

## Federated learning data platforms in high income countries

- Based on ongoing work witht the PLUGIN Healthcare consortium (https://plugin.healthcare)
- The future of secondary health data sharing is federated [@rieke2020future]
- As part of our work we have done a search for federated data sharing projects/solution. Disclaimer, this is not a systematic review, but intended to illustrate current approaches that are taken
- We observe that FHIR and OMOP are the two standards that are used. Briefly explain each of the projects that we have found
  - OMOP:
    - OHDSI analytics [@khalid2021standardized]
  - FHIR:
    - Personal Health Train on FHIR [@choudhury2020personal]
    - CODA project [@mullie2023coda]. Comparing OMOP and FHIR, the latter has been found to support more granular mappings required for analytics and was therefore chosen as the standard for the CODA project.
    - GenoMed4All, in evalution phase for -omis [@cremonesi2023need]
  - hybrid/both:
    - KETOS OMOP-FHIR [@gruendner2019ketos]

- Explain our own choice for FHIR
  - We want as wide a scope as possible, e.g. administrative data or claims data can't fit in OMOP and there are use cases
  - Principle of FHIR Profiles can be tied to principle of late binding: allow ingest of widely different sources, and gradually but more constraints and validations as you move closer to a specific use case
  - If machine learning is the primary objective for secondary use, we want to be able to cast a wider net of relevant data, rather than having very detailed data

## From health information exchanges to health data platforms in low- and middle income countries

The OpenHIE framework [@openhie] has been adopted by many sub-Saharan African countries [@mamuye2022health] as the architectural blueprint for implementing nation-wide health information exchanges (HIE), including Nigeria [@dalhatu2023paper], Kenya [@thaiya2021adoption] and Tanzania [@nsaghurwe2021one]. Conceptually, the OpenHIE framework constitutes a framework for an open digital platform, that mostly focuses on transactional exchange of data, that is, primary data sharing. Given the need to also enable secondary data sharing for academic research, real-world evidence studies etc., African countries have, as a matter of course, extended the framework to include “data & analytics services” as an additional domain.

Based on our direct involvement in implementing and designing health data platforms in these countries, we observed that FHIR was practically the only viable solution. Although FHIR is originally intened for creating a longitudinal database, in fact open source FHIR implementations such as the HAPI FHIR server are the most widely used standards for realizing the so-called Shared Health Record within the OpenHIE architecture.

## Conclusion and outlook

- We underline the need for open data standards as a necessary condition to achieve interoperability
- It is not a sufficient condition
